If I Were to Call You Beautiful

If I were to call you beautiful,
beauty would need a new definition,
because God put you together
to make “gorgeous”
have a more ethereal rendition.

You're beautiful
in the way your energy floats,
like it’s freezing outside,
and you brought infinite codes
so that everyone would feel comfortable.

You're beautiful in how you speak.
The first time you talked to me,
I must have replayed it in my head for a week.

If I were to call you beautiful,
you’d shake your head in blush,
while I’d hold onto the table
as the butterflies start to rush—
because you’re beautiful
in how you listen to an endless stream of thoughts.

I compared the light in your eyes
to those found on ceilings,
but stars don’t share those same watts.

You're beautiful in the way poets string together words,
like every single part of you
was placed into perfection
by a pair of hummingbirds.

You're beautiful
so much so that I need to look away,
because if I look into your eyes,
I forget what I was gonna say.

The sky blues at your absence,
but even when it cries,
the rainbows form
to guide us toward one day realizing
that there’s art in sadness.

I’m sad that you don’t know
that I think you’re so beautiful,
and that made me want to let you go.
Because beauty kept secret
is like standing in the shade.
You never know the sun’s warmth
if, in its absence, you’ve always stayed.

And I should have stayed.
Even if I stood there in awe
with no words to form,
I couldn’t find a single flaw—
because you’re beautiful today,
beautiful tomorrow.

I went and begged the sun
for some of its beauty to borrow,
and it showed me your smile.
Then took a picture of mine,
handed me a pen,
and I described you in every line.
