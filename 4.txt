Everything I Make

Everything I make somehow keeps you in mind,
as if my art is a treasure chest
and I’m leaving clues for you to find.

How wonderful you are.
How you redefined my idea of perfection,
because I thought perfect was impossible
until I got a glimpse of your reflection
and your full smile,
which dips to the side.

If I told everyone perfection was impossible,
meeting you would prove I lied.
Because it isn’t that often
that you meet intelligence incarnate,
not with that sense of humor,
not with your everlasting wit.

Because with you, I want to argue
just to hear what you might say.
I might not survive the comeback,
but hey, it was time I met my match.

Because with you, I want to talk
just to savor your presence for hours,
run back into a grocery store
just to buy you a bouquet of flowers.

Everything I make, I look at with your eyes.
What would you love about it?
What would you think are just lies?

I feel Gatsbyrian, writing for the masses,
praying and hoping that only you will recognize my heart as it passes.
This heart that I created, molded to your touch,
holds back its letters in case writing for you is too much.

Because everything I make somehow carries your aura,
as if I am just the forest
made to hold the prettiest flora.
Where the flowers ask to be sent to you,
the sky blues at your presence lost.
Angels pray to become human
for a chance to come across you.

At my most artistic,
sometimes creativity falters
because of the reality of your perfection.
My poetry never alters; it only accentuates
what you believed was only mine.

You thought me perfect.
I’m convinced you are divine.
So everything I make tries to get you back your wings.
An angel has no business wasting time with earthly things.

Eventually, in heaven, we reunite again.
But you are already an angel among human men,
so I’m not surprised by your greatness,
the light that carried you home.
I’m surprised you made me an angel,
that you weren’t an angel alone.
