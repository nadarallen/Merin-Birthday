                I love being single, but I'd rather be with you instead because I don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering where our story could have led. <br /><br />
                So I think you're really pretty, but when I hear your beauty speak, my mind grips at handrails as my knees begin to weak. <br /><br />
                I think you're so incredibly talented that if talent competed in a show, they would use a picture of you winning as a definition everyone should know. <br /><br />
                I didn't want to be an artist until I saw a picture of you. Now my Instagram is full of paint mesmerized by someone I wish I knew. <br /><br />
                I've never been good at poetry. But if poetry could talk, every stanza would have your smile, every rhyme would show off your walk. <br /><br />
                I think your thoughts are incredible, if incredible meant worthy of being known. I'd like to prove to you the way love feels when it's consistently shown. <br /><br />
                I know we just met, but if my heart was a Tetris game, the existence of all my breaking just disappeared by hearing your name. <br /><br />
                I think you're really funny. But not in look or time. The kind of funny I fell in love with. That makes a biologist need to rhyme. <br /><br />
                Every time you show up on my feed or a new photo is posted I melt at the sight of you like butter on bread freshly toasted. <br /><br />
                I know you like being single, but I'd like to inquire about your heart. And I don't know how to convince you I'm worth it. But this seemed like a good start. <br /><br />
