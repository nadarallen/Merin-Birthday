Being Around You

You want me to say it?
I’ll say it.

Being around you makes me nervous.
But if nerves were a pool, I would high dive, belly flop, embarrass myself
just to try to look cool.

Because you make my heart beat faster.
You don’t mean to. I know.
But when I’m next to you, why would I care to watch any stupid show?

Finish the sentence. Look away.
If I could be next to you, I would let my hyperventilation stay,
because with you, I feel nervous—
but the kind of anxiety that turns to humor.

I’m laughing at how ridiculous it was
that my greatest insecurity was being a late bloomer.

You make me shy,
and that way makes you have to smile.
I can’t look at you for too long,
or my heart grows legs to sprint,
a smile to sprint a mile.

I’m smiling at you.
I’m blushing.
You’re so pretty, by the way,
and I would feel pretty lucky to remind you of that every day.

Being around you makes me jumpy
in a chaotic sort of calm,
as if a heavy metal rock band covered a beautiful ethereal song.

You make me feel excited—maybe you could tell.
Because when your knee kisses mine,
I’m put under a spell
that starts with “oh God” and ends with “please, no more.”

My hands cover my face.
I’ve never been giddy like this before.

So I push my leg closer.
We’re both sitting on the floor,
challenging the limits of tension
until we can’t take it anymore.
