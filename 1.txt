Waiting for You

I am waiting for someone worth loving,
someone worth suffering for,
instead of just suffering in vain.

I sit outside looking for a rainbow,
knowing I will only be met with rain.
So I start to say it’s romantic.

I shield my eyes and feel the water soak in.
When sunshine starts to feel like something I deserve,
then I am a swim.

But as I grow comfortable, the storm changes.
The rain starts to pour,
the lightning becomes too dangerous,
the thunder drowns the city,
and before I know it, I’m drowning.

I tell myself I can swim.
I tell myself a lot of things
as the sunshine starts to dim.

I wait for a new tomorrow.
I shiver and I shake.
I wait for an early morning
that will inevitably still take a summer
and make it winter,
skip over the need to fall.

I’m waiting for you to be someone
I know you will never be at all.
Like mine, like ours,
like a patience to grow.

I ask for too much, or too little from you, I know.
And I wait,
to be yelled at, to be laughed at,
to be kissed,
to be someone worth remembering,
to be someone who is missed.

I speak of bitter woes
like they’re not stones in my shoe.
But I walk around in the rain
and guess what?
I never find you.

I speak of plans like they’re suggestions,
because if they were serious, the earth would shake.
The morning is just morning,
but I still smile for my sake.

I wait for you to say you miss me,
or to say what we had was real.
But I keep making excuses,
and every time I am the one,
I still make it a big deal.
I say you give too much
just so I can accept less.

But you’re like a crossroad of a romance
I no longer want to guess.
I say you’re troubled, wounded,
while I’m bleeding on the phone
that you don’t know any better.

Like you were raised on Earth alone,
you left but didn’t learn,
you learned but didn’t care.
Everyone deserves to be art,
but I’m just an artist to you.
How is that fair?

You were insecure, immature, unavailable,
you didn’t know.
But all of that is bullshit
when, to somebody else’s arms, you go,
because you’re drunk,
because you’re tired,
because they’re not me,
so they’d still be with you.

I’m waiting for you to say
you’ve been waiting for me too.
But what I realized,
what I always knew,
though maybe just chose not to see,
is that if I were to go see the future,
you still wouldn’t have chosen.
You still wouldn’t have chosen me.
